# Software Design Information for Woodruff Lounge Tournament Application

## Individual Designs
This section contains the four individual UML designs

### Design 1

#### Design 1 Pro
Has all the inputs into parameters, additional classes for future growth, clear structure with classes

#### Design 1 Con
Operations in boxes and not on the association lines, missing part of interaction with tournament and match

### Design 2

#### Design 2 Pro
Lots of detail in the classes, clear to read with app and database as utility, have ability to refund money

#### Design 2 Con
Lack of selection between player and manager, add and remove player also in player class

### Design 3

#### Design 3 Pro
Straight forward with how classes interact

#### Design 3 Con
No distinction between player and manager, missing utility class to call historical tournament data

### Design 4

#### Design 4 Pro
Very complete, covered classes for add ons later, holding historical values for all players in a tournament

#### Design 4 Con
Missing database class, more association arrows, missing phone number in addPlayer call, slight confusion on [8,16] username array

## Team Design
This section contains the team UML design

### Design commonalities and differences
Numbered by the design

1. Design1 was similar in thought and contained the basics to meet the requirements as design. It was similar with the thought of the deck class and the currentmode class. The main difference is the detail and the use of utility classes in the team design.
2. Design2 held the similarity with the utility classes and it was the insipration for the team design. The main difference is the lack of the current mode class and deck options.
3. Design3 had a similar thought of how information was passed between the classes. The main difference were the lack of classes to cover extended features.
4. Design4 was the basis for the group UML. As this is the case a few corrections and additions were done. One of the main addtions was the utility classes to help represent the tourney calc algorithm and the database.

### Main design decisions
We decided that Andrew (jjung327) had the most complete UML that required minor changes compared to the other diagrams so we used this as the base line for our team UML. We liked the detail in general and felt that a couple clarifications with the UML design, a couple corrections of variables and additions of utility classes met what was expected in the design as a group after discussion.

## Summary
As a group we started by discussing our individual design information about each of our UMLs and the process that went into developing the diagram. We then went back and talked about what the pro's and con's of the designs were as well as helping with points that we missed individually. We discussed that we should continue, for now, with one video call a week, agreed on the following meeting time and agreed to keeping in touch over google hangouts with what the next steps as a team should be taken.

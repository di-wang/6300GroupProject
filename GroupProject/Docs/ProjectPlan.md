# Project Plan

Author: Ed Redmond <\Team75\>

## 1 Introduction

We have been asked to develop a Tourney Manager application which will run on Android devices.  This application will track on going tournaments, the corresponding matches, historical tournament information,  tournament players and the associated player information.

## 2 Process Description

**Requirements Gathering**

Once the stakeholders have determined that they would like for us to start to work on the development of this application, the project manager will meet with all stakeholders to determine their requirements.  These requirements can be what data needs to be stored, how data needs to be displayed, who needs access to see what data, etc.  Once we have finalized the stakeholder's requirements, the Project Manager will produce the Business Requirements Document (BRD) which they will present to the stakeholders and obtain their sign off on the BRD.  This sign off will signify that we are ready to move on to the Analysis and Design phase of this project.

**Analysis & Design**

After the stakeholders sign off on the Business Requirements Document, the Project Manager will meet with the Architect and deliver the BRD.  The Architect will take the requirements and convert them to UML models.  Once the Architect has finalized the UML models we can move onto the Implementation phase of the project.

**Implementation**

After the UML models have been finalized, the Project Manager then delivers these models to the Development team.  The Development team then take the models and starts to work on the source code.  The Development team will conduct some testing during the implementation process.  Once the Development team is satisfied that the software is ready to be formally tested, it deploys the complied code in the testing/QA environment.

**Testing**

Once the Development team delivers complied code to the testing/QA environment, the Project manager then informs the Testing and QA Managers that they are ready to formally test the developed software. The Testing and QA Managers work with their respective teams to work though the developed test cases and use cases to make sure that the  developed software works according to the requirements that the stakeholders agreed to.

**Deployment**

After testing (beta and UAT) has been completed and the stakeholders have successfully tested the developed software, The Project Manager will work with the Architect and the stakeholders to develop a plan to deploy the developed software.  The Project Manager will also work to ensure that the developed plan is properly and timely executed.

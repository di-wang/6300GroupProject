## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

*This section should provide details about your unit-, integration-, system-, and regression-testing strategies. In particular, it should discuss which activities you will perform as part of your testing process, and who will perform such activities.*

### 1.2 Test Selection

*Here you should discuss how you are going to select your test cases, that is, which black-box and/or white-box techniques you will use. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

The test cases will be assessed on how well they verify the requirements of the system. The test cases will be built in order to cover the original requirements by the customer and additional requirements stated in [Extra Requirements](https://github.gatech.edu/gt-omscs-se-2017spring/6300Spring17Team75/blob/master/GroupProject/Docs/ExtraRequirements.md). All the use cases for the application design are captured in the [Use Case Model](https://github.gatech.edu/gt-omscs-se-2017spring/6300Spring17Team75/blob/master/GroupProject/Docs/UseCaseModel.md) document.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bug tracking will be handled using a form method. We would like to capture the user information that encountered the bug, the screen the bug occured on and a short description of the bug itself. This gives a starting point to reproduce the bug by the developers and a reach back to help them understand more if they can not produce the bug.

Enhancements will also be handled by a form method. The user would submit their information, the suggested enhancement and the reason they think this feature should be added. These will all be aggrogated together by a quality control analyst and sorted by number of instances to determine the enhancement priority.

### 1.5 Technology

The majority of the testing method will be via JUnit. 
*Describe any testing technology you intend to use or build (e.g., JUnit, Selenium).*

## 2 Test Cases

*This section should be the core of this document. You should provide a table of test cases, one per row. For each test case, the table should provide its purpose, the steps necessary to perform the test, the expected result, the actual result (to be filled later), pass/fail information (to be filled later), and any additional information you think is relevant.*
